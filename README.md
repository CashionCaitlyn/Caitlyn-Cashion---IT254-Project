# Caitlyn-Cashion---IT254-Project
The purpose of this alert system is to track motion through the PIR system, and if suspicous motion is detected, an alarm(buzzer) will go off notifying someone there was a motion. 
Can offer better security for households by having better knowledge when someone is passing the sensor
